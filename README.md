# ICC-Profiles
ICC Profiles I've Created
## Notes
All profiles are created with the X-Rite i1 Display Pro. Most are created with DisplayCAL but a few are made with i1 Profiler. All target a white point of 6500K, unless specified.

In the event a folder has multiple profiles, the README.md will distinguish them.

Please note, these profiles *won't be accurate on your display* - even if you have the *exact same panel* there are differences unit to unit - sometimes quite substantial ones. But they may well be substantiall *more accurate* than unprofiled, or using the manufactuer's profile. So, give them a try. But don't rely on them and don't spend a large sum of money ordering prints based on using these for soft proofing :)
